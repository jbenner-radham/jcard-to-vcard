# To-do
> Determine and document the definition schema here, etc.

## Considerations

Currently only the primary value-types are defined as a string.

  ```json
  { "value": "date-and-or-time" }
  ```

Should they be defined via an array for multi-value-types?

```json
{ "value": ["date-and-or-time", "text"] }
```
